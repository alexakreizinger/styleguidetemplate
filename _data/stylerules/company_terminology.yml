      ### Internal vs. external names<br>
      Unless you're referring to a specific function or piece of code that includes an internal codename, always use external names in public-facing documentation.
    examples:
      - |
        Instead of HostileBot, say **Aperture Science Sentry Turret**.
      - |
        Instead of LoveSquare, say **Aperture Science Weighted Companion Cube**.

      ### Failure isn't always bad<br>
      Science relies on failure as much as it relies on success. Rather than berating a test subject for falling into a pit of toxic sludge, thank them for expanding the number of data points available about the effects of prolonged sludge exposure.

      ### Words to avoid<br>
      * Don't refer to test subjects as *guinea pigs* or *lab rats*. Instead, reassure all test subjects that they are active participants in the scientific process and possess far greater cognitive faculties than most rodents ever could.
      * Don't use words like *experiment* or *clinical trial*; instead, say *test* or *Aperture Science Highly-Regulated Data Collection Session*.
