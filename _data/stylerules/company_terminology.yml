      ### Internal vs. external names<br>
      Unless you're referring to a specific function or piece of code that includes an internal codename, always use external names in public-facing documentation.
    examples:
      - |
        Instead of KillBot, say **Aperture Science Sentry Turret**.
      - |
        Instead of ImaginaryFriend, say **Aperture Science Weighted Companion Cube**.

      ### Words to avoid<br>
      * Don't refer to test subjects as *guinea pigs* or *lab rats*. Instead, be sure to reassure all test subjects that they are active participants in the scientific process and possess far greater cognitive faculties than most rodents.
      * Don't use words like *experiment* or *unaccredited clinical trial*; instead, say *test* or *Aperture Science Data Collection Session*.
