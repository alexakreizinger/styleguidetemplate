  - rule: |
      ### Write for non-experts<br>
      Write in a way that's easy for most people to understand, even if the reader isn't an expert in a given topic. A good rule of thumb: estimate the expertise of your average reader, then write for an audience with slightly less expertise than that.

  - rule: |
      However, if there's no way to avoid using complicated words or technical jargon, it's often helpful to give a definition, include [a hyperlink]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.permalink}}formatting-and-organization/#links) to related materials, or provide other additional context.
    examples:

        **Example:** Be careful not to cross the black hole's event horizon. An event horizon is the point at which an object's gravity becomes too strong to escape—if you cross the event horizon, you'll never come back.
