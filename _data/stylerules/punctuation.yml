  - rule: |
      ### Colons and capitalization<br>
      If you're using a colon within a self-contained sentence, the first word following the colon should remain lowercase (unless that word is a proper noun).
    examples:
      - |
        **Example:** We use three metrics in our analysis: quality, cost, and speed.

  - rule: |
      ### Clauses<br>
      If two independent clauses are separated by a coordinating conjunction, use a comma unless both clauses are very short.
    examples:
      - |
        **Long:** We built everything slowly over the course of several months, and it all seems to work so far.
      - |
        **Short:** We worked too quickly and it all fell apart.
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      If a dependent clause and an independent clause are separated by a coordinating conjunction, don't use a comma unless the sentence would be unclear without it.
    examples:
      - |
        **Clear without comma:** The vacuum of space is cold and will kill you almost instantly. 
      - |
        **Needs comma for clarity:** Vacuums are unforgiving in space, but clean carpets marvelously well.
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Introductory phrases<br>
      Use a comma after an introductory phrase (like *however* or *furthermore* or *on the other hand*).
    examples:
      - |
        **Example:** Despite this, we reached the mouth of the cave by sundown.

  - rule: |
      ### Serial commas<br>
      Use serial commas (also known as *Oxford commas*).
    examples:
      - |
        **No:** I love my parents, Godzilla and Wonder Woman.
      - |
        **Yes:** I love my parents, Godzilla, and Wonder Woman.

- section: Dashes and hyphens
  topics:

  - rule: |
      ### Em dashes<br>
      You can use em dashesâ€”just don't put spaces between the em dash and the words surrounding it.
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Compound modifiers<br>
      Use a hyphen between compound modifiers unless the first word is in adverb ending in *-ly*. 
    examples:
      - |
        **Hyphenated:** well-learned students
      - |
        **Not hyphenated:** easily performed tasks
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Compound words<br>
      Sometimes it's helpful to hyphenate compound words to avoid ambiguity. A good rule of thumb is to use a hyphen for compound words that aren't widely used or that could be mistaken for another word.
    examples:
      - |
        **Hyphenated:** re-create, pre-date<br>
      - |
        **Not hyphenated:** remix, prepaid
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Prefixes<br>
      Use a hyphen between a prefix and a proper noun or abbreviation.
    examples:
      - |
        **Example:** Files with non-JSON syntax are unsupported.
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Suspended hyphens<br>
      Use suspended hyphens to list several hyphenated compounds in a row.
    examples:
      - |
        **Example:** The craft fair offers soap- and basket-making classes.
      - |
        **Example:** Bills come in one-, five, and twenty-dollar increments.

- section: Parentheses
  topics:

  - rule: |
      ### Avoid critical information<br>
      Some readers may skip over any text that isn't part of the main sentence, so try not to include any critical information inside parentheses.
    audience: [tw, dev]

  - rule: |
      ### End punctuation<br>
      Place end punctuation marks (like commas and periods) outside parentheses unless the punctuation is part of the parenthetical text or the parentheses contain a standalone sentence.
    examples:
      - |
        **Outside parentheses:** It's legal to own a zebra in certain states (like Nevada).
      - |
        **Inside parentheses:** It's legal to own a zebra in certain states. (Nevada is one of them.)
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Mid-sentence parentheticals<br>
      Parenthetical statements are useful for mid-sentence examples and short asides (like this one), but excessively long and complicated parentheticals may be better of rewritten as their own sentence (or else you'll end up with a meandering, monstrous behemoth of a sentence that seems to go on and on and on with no end in sight).

- section: Semicolons
  topics:

  - rule: |
      ### Avoid overuse<br>
      Semicolons are your friend; however, like any friend, you might get sick of them if they show up too frequently. Tread carefully and wisely.
    audience: [tw, dev, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Clauses<br>
      You can use a semicolon to connect two independent clauses.
    examples:
      - |
        **Example:** The film received terrible reviews; none of the reviewers could even stay awake through the whole thing.
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      You can also use a semicolon to connect two independent clauses connected by a conjunctive adverb (like *however* or *similarly*) or, occasionally, a regular old conjunction (like *and* or *but* or *if*).
    examples:
      - |
        **Example:** Most mountains aren't as tall as Everest; however, they still pose a suitable challenge for climbers.
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      But consider carefully whether you really need a semicolon or if you'd be better off breaking things into two separate sentences.
    audience: [tw, mktg]

  - rule: |
      ### Lists<br>
      When commas alone won't suffice, you can use semicolons to separate complex items in a series or list.
    examples:
      - |
        **Example:** Our team includes May, a prestigious researcher; Brendan, a tenacious explorer; and Wally, a skilled analyst.
