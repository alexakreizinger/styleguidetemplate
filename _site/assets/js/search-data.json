Although most dialog boxes are technically pop-ups, don’t refer to them as pop-ups. | Pane: A distinct section or area within a larger window or page. Don’t use the word panel as a substitute. | Card: A small pane that displays specific information about a single topic. Users can often interact with cards to reveal more information or actions related to a topic. Cards tend to resemble physical cards, sticky notes, or tiles.

If applicable, you can specify one of the following menu types: . | Dropdown menu: A collapsible menu that lets you select from a list of items. | Menu bar: A menu displayed across the top of a page or window. Menu bars often contain multiple dropdown menus (for example, Photoshop’s menu bar includes File, Edit, Image, Layer, Select, and so on.) . | Sidebar: A menu displayed on the side of a page, often used for navigation purposes. In some circumstances, users can choose to hide the sidebar when it’s not in use. | Navigation menu: Any menu that lets you navigate between multiple pages.

Rules that apply to someone designing a user interface, for example, may not apply to someone writing press releases, so it doesn’t make sense to use a single style guide for both. On the other hand, other rules certainly will apply to both audiences, and it can be tough to keep these rules in sync if they’re sourced from entirely separate guides. This template strikes a balance between the need to maintain discrete rules for separate audiences with the need to unify rules that apply to one or more audiences. Although certain style rules appear multiple times throughout this guide, each rule was only recorded in a single location; by using a tagging system, each rule is automatically populated in the relevant sections for any applicable audience (i.e., Developers, Marketers, and/or Technical Writers. As such, if you ever need to edit or delete a rule, you only need to edit the rule’s source file instead of painstakingly editing the three separate sections where it could possibly appear. This template is also designed to be scalable, regardless of whether you have three audiences or thirty. ",

    "title": "How it works",
    "content": "TL;DR: A combination of YAML files, include tags, and Liquid variables that essentially turn your style ruleset into a mini database. (This is somehow both more complicated and less complicated than it sounds, but don’t worry—I’ve already brute-forced my way through Jekyll’s idiosyncrasies so you don’t have to.) . Style rules and YAML . Lists of style rules are stored in a series of YAML files in the _data/stylerules/ directory. For example, a basic ruleset file called punctuation.yml might look like this: . description: Rules about punctuation. rules: - section: Semicolons topics: - rule: | ### Avoid overuse&lt;br&gt; Semicolons are your friend; however, like any friend, you might get sick of them if they show up too frequently. Tread carefully and wisely. audience: [tw, dev, mktg] - rule: | ### Clauses&lt;br&gt; You can use a semicolon to connect two independent clauses. examples: - | **Example:** The film received terrible reviews; none of the reviewers could even stay awake through the whole thing. audience: [tw, mktg] . There’s a lot going on here, but the most important thing to note so far is the audience key. The first rule has the tw, mktg, and dev tags, corresponding to Technical Writers, Developers, and Marketers, respectively. The second rule, on the other hand, only applies to Technical Writers and Marketers. Here’s a slightly expanded example of the punctuation.yml ruleset file: . description: Rules about punctuation. - section: Commas topics: - rule: | ### Clauses&lt;br&gt; If two independent clauses are separated by a coordinating conjunction, use a comma unless both clauses are very short. examples: - | **Long:** We built everything slowly over the course of several months, and it all seems to work so far. - | **Short:** We worked too quickly and it all fell apart. audience: [tw, mktg] - rule: | If a dependent clause and an independent clause are separated by a coordinating conjunction, don't use a comma unless the sentence would be unclear without it. examples: - | **Clear without comma:** The vacuum of space is cold and will kill you almost instantly. - | **Needs comma for clarity:** Vacuums are unforgiving in space, but clean carpets marvelously well. audience: [tw, mktg] - rule: | ### Serial commas&lt;br&gt; Use serial commas (also known as *Oxford commas*). examples: - | **No:** I love my parents, Godzilla and Wonder Woman. - | **Yes:** I love my parents, Godzilla, and Wonder Woman. audience: [tw, dev, mktg] featured: | [Use serial commas.]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.permalink}}punctuation/#serial-commas) rules: - section: Semicolons topics: - rule: | ### Avoid overuse&lt;br&gt; Semicolons are your friend; however, like any friend, you might get sick of them if they show up too frequently. Tread carefully and wisely. audience: [tw, dev, mktg] - rule: | ### Clauses&lt;br&gt; You can use a semicolon to connect two independent clauses. examples: - | **Example:** The film received terrible reviews; none of the reviewers could even stay awake through the whole thing. audience: [tw, mktg] . Taken as a whole, this file creates a Punctuation ruleset with two sections: Commas and Semicolons. Each of these sections includes various rules. Each rule has, at a minimum, the actual body of a rule and the audience to whom it applies. Some rules also have examples; other rules have a featured tag, which consists of a short blurb and a hyperlink, but the hyperlink uses Liquid tags to ensure that any fetched content is populated with the correct URL path. Include tags . There are several files in the _includes folder that contain Liquid loops to iterate over each rule file and pull the relevant information, depending on your needs. get_all_rules.md does exactly what it says—it fetches a list of all rules in a given YAML file, regardless of audience. get_rules_for_audience.md accepts an audience variable and fetches a list of any rules in a given YAML file that are tagged with the provided audience. For example, you might want to fetch all rules that apply to Developers. get_featured_rules_for_audience.md accepts an audience variable and fetches a list of any featured rules in a given YAML file. These featured rules are displayed on an audience’s landing page and include hyperlinks to the section where the featured rule resides. Audience pages . Each audience has a subfolder in the pages folder—for example, pages/dev/ for Developers. Each audience subfolder includes a main landing page (which is where featured rules are displayed) and individual pages corresponding to the different YAML rulesets. These audience pages have no content, just Liquid variables and include tags. Putting it all together . So, for example, if you use the following Liquid tags in pages/dev/dev_punctuation.md, where page.audience is defined in the file’s YAML frontmatter and has a value of dev: . {% assign file = site.data.stylerules.punctuation %} {% assign aud = page.audience %} {% include get_rules_for_audience.md filename=file audience=aud %} . You’d get a list of all punctuation rules that apply to the dev audience. Based on the expanded punctuation.yml file above, your output would look like this (but instead of in a code block it’d be correctly rendered in Markdown): . # Punctuation Rules about punctuation. ## Commas ### Serial commas Use serial commas (also known as *Oxford commas*). * **No:** I love my parents, Godzilla and Wonder Woman. * **Yes:** I love my parents, Godzilla, and Wonder Woman. ## Semicolons ### Avoid overuse Semicolons are your friend; however, like any friend, you might get sick of them if they show up too frequently. Tread carefully and wisely. Notice how only rules that had the dev tag showed up here? Instead of having to copy/paste them individually, we let Liquid do the heavy lifting for us. And if you were to repeat this process with a different YAML file or for a different audience tag, you’d get a completely different output from the same source files! . ",

In-text hyperlinks are a useful way to direct readers’ attention towards similar topics and related materials, especially if you don’t want to break the flow of a document to explain an important word or concept. If you need to provide additional context for your readers, try linking to another post about that topic, a glossary entry that expands upon the definition of a term, or a guide with more detailed information about a specific parameter or object. Descriptive link text . Use descriptive, non-obtrusive link text that doesn’t disrupt the flow of the sentence. For example, to link to a doc called “Get Started With FraudSensor”: . | No: To get started with FraudSensor (link), you’ll need to set up a detection tag. | Also no: To get started with Fraudsensor, you’ll need to set up a detection tag. Click here to learn more. | Yes: To get started with FraudSensor, you’ll need to set up a detection tag. | . One way to write descriptive links is to use link text that’s similar to the title of the link destination or provides additional information about the page you’re linking to. If you include the exact title of a page, match the capitalization of that title. | Example: Follow the steps outlined in Getting Started With FraudSensor before proceeding. | . If you don’t include the exact title of a page, capitalize the link text as if it were part of a normal sentence. | Example: Make sure you’ve installed FraudSensor before proceeding. | . However, if it’s too hard to seamlessly integrate a link into a sentence, you can also write a new, complete sentence that directs readers towards a relevant topic. These sentences should typically begin with a phrase like “For more information,” or “To learn more about [topic],” before including the link. | Example: For more information, consult our FraudSensor Parameters guide. | .
